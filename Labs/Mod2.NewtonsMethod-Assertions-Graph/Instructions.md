## implement java program that uses Newton-Raphsons'


program terminates when the difference between the

x(n+1) <= x(n) + (0.00001)
&&
w/in 2000 iterations
or shows NotFound
---

find as many roots as possible

start with guessed (x0) value -> randomly generated

after program terminates(?)

list
- each guessed x0 value:
- derived root
- number of iterations to find the root
- value of polyn after plugging in root





f(x) = ax6 – bx5 + cx4 – dx3+ ex2 – fx + g = 0

f'(x) = 6(a)x5-5x4+ 4x3 - 3dx2 +2ex -f =0
